1. Session variables that I will make available when a user logs in:
	1. userid
	2. username
	3. email
	4. name
	There will be others added as we move forward.  
	
	You can access these in php by doing $_SESSION["userid"] for the userid.
	
	Note: All session variables will be available anytime you create a new user object.  Ex. $user = new User($_POST);
